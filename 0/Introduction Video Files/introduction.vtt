00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.110
Hello and welcome to Machine Learning with Python.
In this course you'll learn how Machine Learning

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.920
is used in many key fields and industries.
For example, in the healthcare industry, data

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.380
scientists use Machine Learning to predict whether
a human cell that is believed to be at risk of

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.460
developing cancer is either benign or malignant.
As such, Machine Learning can play a key role

5
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.330
in determining a person's health and welfare.
You'll also learn about the value of decision

6
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.810
trees and how building a good decision tree from
historical data helps doctors to prescribe the

7
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.650
proper medicine for each of their patients.You'll
learn how bankers use Machine Learning to make

8
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.490
decisions on whether to approve loan applications;
and you will learn how to use Machine Learning to

9
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.910
do bank customer segmentation, where it is
not usually easy to run for huge volumes of

10
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.220
varied data. In this course you'll see how machine
learning helps websites such as YouTube, Amazon,

11
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.550
or Netflix develop recommendations to their
customers about various products or services,

12
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.450
such as which movies they might be interested in
going to see or which books to buy. There is so

13
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.450
much that you can do with Machine Learning.
Here you'll learn how to use popular Python

14
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.890
libraries to build your model. For example, given
an automobile data set, we can use the scikit-learn

15
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.900
library to estimate the co2 emission of cars
using their engine size or cylinders. We can

16
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.650
even predict what the co2 emissions will be for a
car that hasn't even been produced yet, and we'll

17
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.340
see how the telecommunications industries can
predict customer churn.You can run and practice

18
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.940
the code of all these samples using the built-in
lab environment in this course, you don't have to

19
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.050
install anything to your computer or do anything
on the cloud. All you have to do is click a button

20
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.020
to start the lab environment in your browser.
The code for the samples is already written

21
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.340
using Python language in Jupyter notebooks and
you can run it to see the results or change it to

22
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.440
understand the algorithms better. So what will you
be able to achieve by taking this course? Well,

23
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.370
by putting in just a few hours a week over the
next few weeks you'll get new skills to add to

24
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.680
your resume such as regression, classification,
clustering, scikit-learn, and psy PI. You'll

25
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.050
also get new projects that you can add to
your portfolio including cancer detection,

26
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.370
predicting economic trends, predicting customer
churn, recommendation engines, and many more.

27
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.080
You'll also get a certificate in Machine Learning
to prove your competency and share it anywhere

28
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.400
you like online or offline such as LinkedIn
profiles and social media, so let's get started.
