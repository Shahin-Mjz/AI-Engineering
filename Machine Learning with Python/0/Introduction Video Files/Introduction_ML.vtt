00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Hello, and welcome!

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.839
In this video I will give you a high level introduction to Machine Learning.

3
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.480
So let’s get started.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.520
This is a human cell sample extracted from a patient,

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.240
and this cell has characteristics. For example, its clump thickness is 6, its uniformity

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.660
of cell size is 1, its marginal adhesion is 1, and so on.

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.910
One of the interesting questions we can ask, at this point is: Is this a benign or malignant

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.270
cell?

9
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.750
In contrast with a benign tumor, a malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.660
tissue or spread around the body, and diagnosing it early might be the key to a patient’s

11
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.660
survival.

12
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.000
One could easily presume that only a doctor with years of experience could diagnose that

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.510
tumor and say if the patient is developing cancer or not.

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.670
Right?

15
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.360
Well, imagine that you’ve obtained a dataset containing characteristics of thousands of

16
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.720
human cell samples extracted from patients who were believed to be at risk of developing

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.530
cancer.

18
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.850
Analysis of the original data showed that many of the characteristics differed significantly

19
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.430
between benign and malignant samples.

20
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.290
You can use the values of these cell characteristics in samples from other patients to give an

21
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.200
early indication of whether a new sample might be benign or malignant.

22
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.540
You should clean your data, select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model,

23
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.799
and train your model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data.

24
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.850
Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict

25
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.880
your new or unknown cell with a rather high accuracy.

26
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.140
This is machine learning!

27
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.920
It is the way that a machine learning model can do a doctor’s task or at least help

28
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.060
that doctor make the process faster.

29
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.280
Now, let me give a formal definition of machine learning.

30
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.909
Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability

31
00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.290
to learn without being explicitly programmed.”

32
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.159
Let me explain what I mean when I say “without being explicitly programmed.”

33
00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.500
Assume that you have a dataset of images of animals such as cats and dogs, and you want

34
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.529
to have software or an application that can recognize and differentiate them.

35
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:41.739
The first thing that you have to do here is interpret the images as a set of feature sets.

36
00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.900
For example, does the image show the animal’s eyes?

37
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.379
If so, what is their size?

38
00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.889
Does it have ears?

39
00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.370
What about a tail?

40
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.370
How many legs?

41
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.120
Does it have wings?

42
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.400
Prior to machine learning, each image would be transformed to a vector of features.

43
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.760
Then, traditionally, we had to write down some rules or methods in order to get computers

44
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.889
to be intelligent and detect the animals.

45
00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.339
But, it was a failure.

46
00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.339
Why?

47
00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:18.879
Well, as you can guess, it needed a lot of rules, highly dependent on the current dataset,

48
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.489
and not generalized enough to detect out-of-sample cases.

49
00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.040
This is when machine learning entered the scene.

50
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.370
Using machine learning, allows us to build a model that looks at all the feature sets,

51
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.239
and their corresponding type of animals, and it learns the pattern of each animal.

52
00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.159
It is a model built by machine learning algorithms.

53
00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.049
It detects without explicitly being programmed to do so.

54
00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.760
In essence, machine learning follows the same process that a 4-year-old child uses to learn,

55
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.859
understand, and differentiate animals.

56
00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:03.430
So, machine learning algorithms, inspired by the human learning process, iteratively

57
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.159
learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.

58
00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.530
These models help us in a variety of tasks, such as object recognition, summarization,

59
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.989
recommendation, and so on.

60
00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.560
Machine Learning impacts society in a very influential way.

61
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.919
Here are some real-life examples.

62
00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.410
First, how do you think Netflix and Amazon recommend videos, movies, and TV shows to its users?

63
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.139
They use Machine Learning to produce suggestions that you might enjoy!

64
00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.439
This is similar to how your friends might recommend a television show to you, based

65
00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.550
on their knowledge of the types of shows you like to watch.

66
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.880
How do you think banks make a decision when approving a loan application?

67
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.169
They use machine learning to predict the probability of default for each applicant, and then approve

68
00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.700
or refuse the loan application based on that probability.

69
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.199
Telecommunication companies use their customers’ demographic data to segment them, or predict

70
00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.540
if they will unsubscribe from their company the next month.

71
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.330
There are many other applications of machine learning that we see every day in our daily

72
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:25.500
life, such as chatbots, logging into our phones or even computer games using face recognition.

73
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.229
Each of these use different machine learning techniques and algorithms.

74
00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.969
So, let’s quickly examine a few of the more popular techniques.

75
00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:40.080
The Regression/Estimation technique is used for predicting a continuous value. For example,

76
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.389
predicting things like the price of a house based on its characteristics, or to estimate

77
00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.870
the Co2 emission from a car’s engine.

78
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.580
A Classification technique is used for Predicting the class or category of a case, for example,

79
00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.030
if a cell is benign or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn.

80
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.910
Clustering groups of similar cases, for example, can find similar patients, or can be used

81
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.830
for customer segmentation in the banking field.

82
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.469
Association technique is used for finding items or events that often co-occur, for example,

83
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.090
grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer.

84
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.249
Anomaly detection is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases, for example, it is used

85
00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.150
for credit card fraud detection.

86
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.650
Sequence mining is used for predicting the next event, for instance, the click-stream

87
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.439
in websites.

88
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.710
Dimension reduction is used to reduce the size of data.

89
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.509
And finally, recommendation systems, this associates people's preferences with others

90
00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:54.289
who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.

91
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.530
We will cover some of these techniques in the next videos.

92
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.789
By this point, I’m quite sure this question has crossed your mind, “What is the difference

93
00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:09.330
between these buzzwords that we keep hearing these days, such as Artificial intelligence

94
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.040
(or AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning?”

95
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.520
Well, let me explain what is different between them.

96
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.150
In brief, AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions

97
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.639
of humans.

98
00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:31.440
So, Artificial Intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision,

99
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.830
Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization.

100
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.469
Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial

101
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:43.469
intelligence.

102
00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:49.099
It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples,

103
00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:55.960
learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations.

104
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.219
And Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually

105
00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:05.999
learn and make intelligent decisions on their own.

106
00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:12.919
Deep learning involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms.

107
00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:17.550
Now that we’ve completed the introduction to Machine Learning, subsequent videos will

108
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:23.180
focus on reviewing two main components: First, you’ll be learning about the purpose

109
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.680
of Machine Learning and where it can be applied in the real world; and

110
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.990
Second, you’ll get a general overview of Machine Learning topics, such as supervised

111
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:39.370
vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation and various Machine Learning algorithms.

112
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.481
So now that you have a sense with what’s in store on this journey, let’s continue

113
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.920
our exploration of Machine Learning!

114
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.450
Thanks for watching!

115
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.000
